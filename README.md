Functional analysis symbols for LaTeX and LilyPond.  
This repository is part of the **`openLilyLib`** family of resources.

---

Currently this repository is only a placeholder for future development.

**`riemann`**'s goal is to implement support for functional analysis symbols to use in LaTeX as well as in LilyPond.
This should not be realized graphically but be made possible with arbitrary fonts.
